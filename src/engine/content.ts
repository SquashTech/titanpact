// Shared content vocabulary — the engine's contract with /src/data.
// All acquirable content (heroes, moves, ...) is pure data conforming to these
// shapes. The engine interprets data; it never contains bespoke per-content
// logic. See CLAUDE.md "Architecture" and docs/architecture.md repo map.
//
// SCOPE NOTE: this first slice only models damage-dealing moves — enough to
// prove the turn/round loop and the two damage pipelines end to end. Statuses,
// abilities, equipment and relic hooks all build on the "effect primitives /
// trigger hooks / condition vocabulary" contracts, and the condition vocabulary
// (the sixth contract) is explicitly OPEN per docs/architecture.md. Extending
// MoveDefinition.kind beyond 'damage' is future work gated on that decision —
// do not speculatively add it here.
